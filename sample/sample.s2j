  Son: Dad! Hello? Can you hear me?
  Dad: Johnny, my boy! Can you hear me alright?
  Son: Yeah, dad. I can hear you. Can you hear me?
  Dad: Yes! Yes, it's good to hear you again, Johnny. How are you doing?
  Son: Good, dad. I'm doing good.
  Dad: Look! I got springrolls! I made 'em this morning, so they're damn ugly. The cooking ladies on the internet make everything look so easy.
  Son: It looks really good, dad. You're getting a lot better at it.
  Dad: I'm gonna get you to try it once you can get home. I'll keep practicing. Maybe one of these days, they'll taste like your mom's.
  Son: Yeah, that'd be great.
  Dad: What have you got, Johnny?

  Dad: Oh, Johnny. I keep tellin' you that those things aren't good for you. Full of plastic and chemicals. You gotta watch your health, or you'll regret it when you get to my age.
  Son: I know, dad. Work just really tires me out.

  Son: So, what else did you do today? Munch munch munch...
  Dad: Munch munch munch... Not a lot. I took a nap and watched some TV. There's never anything interesting on anymore. Not things I like, anyway.
  Son: That sounds nice. I think I'll have to do overtime again this weekend. Not looking forward to that. Munch munch munch...
  Dad: They're working you half to death! Munch munch munch... You gotta find a place that treats you better, Johnny. I'm telling you, I never worked overtime like you do when I was your age.
  Son: I know, dad. I'm looking. Munch munch munch...
