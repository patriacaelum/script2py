Making A Decision
-------------------

# Ask questions to make a decision about which branch to take.

Narrator: Let's cut to the chase: do you prefer film or theatre?

*** Watcher: Film.
    <<{ watcher.preference = film }>>

*** Watcher: Theatre.
    <<{ watcher.preference = theatre }>>

Narrator: Alright, let's test that. Which of these have you heard of?

*** Watcher: All About Eve.
    --> Exerpt from All About Eve

*** Watcher: Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.
    --> Exerpt from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof

*** Watcher: Neither.

Narrator: Well, fine. You get nothing.

Exerpt from All About Eve
---------------------------

# All About Eve is written by Joseph L. Mackiewicz.

Addison: What do you take me for?

Eve: I don't know that I take you for anything...

Addison: It is possible -- even conceivable -- that you've confused me with
    that gang of backward children you've been playing tricks on -- that you
    have the same contempt for me that you have for them?

Eve: I'm sure you mean something by that, Addison, but I don't know what...

Addison: Look closely, Eve, it's time you did. I am Addison deWitt. I'm
    nobody's fool. Least of all -- yours.

Eve: I never intended you to be.

Addison: Yes, you did. You still do.

<<{ eve.portrait = standing }>>

Eve: I still don't know what you're getting at. Right now I want to take my
    nap. It's important that I --

<<{ addison.portrait = aggressive }>>

Addison: -- it's important right now that we talk. Killer to killer.

Exerpt from Cat on a Hot Tin Roof
-----------------------------------

# Cat on a Hot Tin Roof is written by Tennesse Williams.
# This exerpt is from Act One.

Brick: I didn't get him a present.

Margaret: I got one for you.

Brick: All right. You write the card, then.

Margaret: And have him know you didn't remember his birthday?

Brick: I didn't remember his birthday.

Margaret: You don't have to prove you didn't!

Brick: I don't to to fool him about it.

Margaret: Just write 'Love, Brick!' for God's --

Brick: No.

Margaret: You've got to!

Brick: I don't have to do anything I don't want to do. You keep forgetting the
    conditions on which I agreed to stay on living with you.

Margaret: I'm not living with you. We occupy the same cage.

Brick: You've got to remember the conditions agreed on.

Margaret: They're impossible conditions!
